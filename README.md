## About me

<p>
  I'm a junior front-end developer, who's as passionate about new challenges as this project was.
  Before this challenge I had not worked with dates and stepping out of my comfort zone is something inherent to my profession, it is something that stimulates me and helps me to develop faster.
  Some of the challenges I encountered in this project were:
  Working with a calendar in Next.Js wasn't as simple as I thought, but after hours of head banging I managed to solve the difficulties and learn more about it.
